## Set Up

Clone repository, install dependencies, and run the dev script to start the docs.

```bash
gh repo clone @ensdomains/thorin
cd thorin
pnpm i
```

## Component Groups

Components are organized in folders according to the [`Atomic Design Methodology`](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/).

**Atoms** serve as the foundational building blocks that comprise all our user interfaces. These atoms include basic HTML elements like form labels, inputs, buttons, and others that canâ€™t be broken down any further without ceasing to be functional.

**Molecules** are relatively simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit. For example, a form label, search input, and button can join together to create a search form molecule.

**Organisms** are relatively complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms. These organisms form distinct sections of an interface.

## Adding Components

Adding a component requires adding and modifying several files. The different steps to adding a component are:

### 1. Create a component file

The react component should be named using [`pascal case`](https://techterms.com/definition/pascalcase) convention (e.g. PascalCase). The react component file should use the component name with a **.tsx** file extension. It should be added to a folder named as the component name and nested in the [`Component Group`](#component-groups) folder at _components/src/components_.

### 2. Create a component test file

The react component test file should have the same name as the component a **.test.tsx** file extension. It should be located in the same directory as the component file.

### 3. Create a component index file

The react component and type should be exported in an index file in the same directory as the component file. If a generic Props type was used, export it using an alias.

```tsx
export { ComponentName } from './ComponentName'
export type { Props as ComponentNameProps } from './ComponentName'
```

### 4. Add the component to the exports in the Component Group index file

The react component should be added to the list of exports in the index file located in the [`Component Group`](#component-groups) folder in _components/src/components_. Only the react component needs to be exported.

### 5. Create a mdx file

The component mdx file should have the same name as the react component with a **.docs.mdx** file extension. It should be added to the [`Component Group`](#component-groups) folder in _docs/src/reference/mdx_.

### 6. Create a snippets file

The component snippets file should have the same name as the react component with a **.snippets.tsx** file extension. It should be added to the [`Component Group`](#component-groups) folder in _docs/src/reference/snippets_.

### 7. Add the component to the module export test

Add the component to the module export test located at _components/src/index.test.tsx_.

## Scaffolding Components

A generator script is available that will perform items 1 - 6 of [Adding Components](#adding-components). **Adding the component to the module export test must be done manually.** Access the script using:

```bash
yarn gen:component
```

## Style Guidelines

### Components

Use **functional components** with hooks and **avoid using inline styles**.

**Add displayName** to component. This is neccessary for playroom to generate snippets from code.

```tsx
const Component = () => <div />

Component.displayName = 'Component'
```

### Snippets

Playroom uses [react-element-to-jsx-string](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-element-to-jsx-string) to convert a react component into a string which can be used by playroom. In certain situations it is not able to accurately convert the element, such as if the components' children includes a function.

If you are having problems with your snippet in playroom, convert your snippet code to a single line string. **Do not use backslash** to break the string into multiple lines.

```tsx
export const snippets: Snippet[] = [
  {
    name: 'Basic',
    code: '<FileInput>{(context) => context.name ? <div>{context.name}</div> : <div>Attach a file</div>}</FileInput>',
  },
]
```

### Docs

When you need to import a component within the _docs/_ folder, **link to components from @ensdomains/thorin**.

```
import { Field } from '@ensdomains/thorin'
```

For updates to components to appear in files in the _docs/_ folder, you will first need to **build the components** using:

```bash
yarn build:components
```

## Adding Icons

Add a `.svg` file in pascal case to the `icons` folder and run:

```bash
yarn gen:icons
```

All files in the `icons` directory are automatically converted to React components and exported for use. Generated icons should follow a 24x24 bounding box.

## Test

```bash
yarn test
```

## Build

To build the comopnents in the components library use:

```bash
yarn build:components
```

To build the entire project use:

```bash
yarn build
```

## Publishing New Versions

[Create a new release](https://github.com/ensdomains/thorin/releases/new) on GitHub with a tag that follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Publishing a release triggers a workflow for building, testing, and pushing to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ensdomains/thorin).

## Common Issues

### My component did not update in my mdx file?

Update the component using `yarn build:component` and reload the page after the script has completed.

### My snippet looks malformed

Check if displayName has been added to component. If not, then you may need to conver the snippet to a string. See the [snippets section](#snippets) for more details.

### Playroom is giving an error that a component or module is not available

Check if the module or component has been exported in _docs/src/playroom/components.ts_.

### Code preview in mdx file is giving an error that a component or module is not available

Check that the component or module is included in the scope property of the LiveProvider component in _docs/src/components/CodePreview/CodePreview.tsx_.

### The value in the Type column in the documentation props table is oddly formatted.

You can customize the format of the type value by adding conditions to the function **formatPropType** in _docs/src/components/PropsTable.tsx_.
