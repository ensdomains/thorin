## Install

```bash
pnpm i @ensdomains/thorin
```

## Set Up

Wrap the root of your app in a ThemeProvider. Import **ThorinGlobalStyles** and declare it as a child of **ThemeProvider**. Import **lightTheme** or **darkTheme** and pass it to the **ThemeProvider**. Add [Satoshi](https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/satoshi) to your font stack.

In this example we are adding the **lightTheme**.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { ThemeProvider } from '@ensdomains/thorin'
import 'thorin/dist/thorin.css'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={lightTheme}>
      {children}
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```

### Dark Theme

To use the dark theme, import `darkTheme` and pass it to the `ThemeProvider`.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { ThemeProvider, darkTheme } from '@ensdomains/thorin'
import 'thorin/dist/thorin.css'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={darkTheme}>
      {children}
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```

### Custom Themes

To customise the theme, you can change properties on either the `lightTheme` or `darkTheme` objects, or create an entirely new one.

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider, lightTheme } from '@ensdomains/thorin'

const theme = {
  ...lightTheme,
  colors: {
    ...lightTheme.colors,
    foreground: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4)',
  },
}

const App = () => {
  return <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>{children}</ThemeProvider>
}
```

## Use Components

```tsx
import { Button, LockSVG } from '@ensdomains/thorin'
```

```tsx live=true expand=true
<Box alignItems="center" gap="4">
  <div style={{ width: '180px' }}>
    <Button prefix={LockSVG} variant="primary">
      Connect Wallet
    </Button>
  </div>
</Box>
```

## Component Groups

Thorin is organized according to the [`Atomic Design Methodology`](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/).

**Atoms** serve as the foundational building blocks that comprise all our user interfaces. These atoms include basic HTML elements like form labels, inputs, buttons, and others that canâ€™t be broken down any further without ceasing to be functional.

**Molecules** are relatively simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit. For example, a form label, search input, and button can join together to create a search form molecule.

**Organisms** are relatively complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms. These organisms form distinct sections of an interface.
